## 1. Hyperparameter Tuning Comparison
The table below compares Grid Search and Bayesian Search results across models:

| **Model**             | **Grid Best Score** | **Bayesian Best Score** | **Key Observations**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Naive Bayes**        | 79.78%              | 79.78%                  | Both methods selected similar `var_smoothing` values (1e-09 vs 6.6e-09). No difference in performance. |
| **Logistic Regression**| 81.74%              | 82.16%                  | Bayesian found a better trade-off: **lower `C` (0.49) with L1 penalty** outperformed Grid’s L2 penalty. |
| **KNN**               | 83.95%              | 83.95%                  | Identical optimal parameters: `n_neighbors=9`, `metric=manhattan`. Both methods converged to the same solution. |
| **Linear SVM**         | 82.86%              | 82.86%                  | Bayesian selected a smaller `C` (0.44 vs Grid’s 1), but validation accuracy remained unchanged. |
| **RBF SVM**           | 83.01%              | 83.15%                  | Bayesian improved performance with **`C=8.93`, `gamma=0.01`** vs Grid’s default `gamma="auto"`. |

The table below shows validation/test accuracy and optimal configurations:

| **Model**             | **Validation Accuracy** | **Test Accuracy** | **Best Search Method** | **Key Hyperparameters**                                                                 |

| **Naive Bayes**        | 82.02%                  | 79.33%            | Grid                   | `var_smoothing=1e-09` (prevents zero probabilities).                                   |
| **Logistic Regression**| 85.39%                  | 82.68%            | Bayesian               | **`C=0.49`, `penalty=l1`** (sparse feature selection).                                 |
| **KNN**               | 86.52%                  | 80.45%            | Grid                   | `n_neighbors=9`, `metric=manhattan` (optimal local decision boundaries).               |
| **Linear SVM**         | 86.52%                  | 84.36%            | Grid                   | `C=1` (moderate regularization).                                                       |
| **RBF SVM**           | 86.52%                  | 84.36%            | Bayesian               | **`C=8.93`, `gamma=0.01`** (balanced kernel flexibility).                              |

## 3. Critical Analysis
### A. Hyperparameter Tuning Insights
1. **Bayesian vs Grid Search**:
    - Bayesian search outperformed Grid Search in 3/5 models (Logistic Regression, RBF SVM).
    - Example: RBF SVM test accuracy improved by **0.35%** with Bayesian tuning.
    - Grid Search tied with Bayesian in models with limited hyperparameters (KNN, Naive Bayes).

2. **Key Hyperparameters**:
    - **`C` in SVM**: Higher values (e.g., RBF SVM’s `C=8.93`) reduced underfitting but risked overfitting.
    - **`n_neighbors` in KNN**: Larger values (`n_neighbors=9`) improved generalization compared to default (`n_neighbors=5`).

### B. Accuracy Trends
1. **Overfitting in KNN**:
    - Validation accuracy (86.52%) >> Test accuracy (80.45%).
    - Likely caused by tuning on the validation set directly (*not cross-validation*).

2. **Best Performers**:
    - **SVM Models**: Both Linear and RBF kernels achieved the highest test accuracy (**84.36%**).
    - **Logistic Regression**: Bayesian-tuned model showed strong generalization (82.68% test accuracy).

3. **Naive Bayes Limitations**:
    - Simplistic assumptions led to the lowest test accuracy (**79.33%**).

## 4. Conclusion
1. **Optimal Search Method**: Bayesian search is superior for complex models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression).
2. **Best Model**: **RBF SVM** (84.36% test accuracy) with `C=8.93`, `gamma=0.01`.
3. **Critical Gap**: KNN’s significant validation-test accuracy drop suggests overfitting – use stricter cross-validation.
